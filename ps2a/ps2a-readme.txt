Duy Truong

Explanation:
I use the string to store the register bits, it start from the index 0. In the LFSR,
I use the opposite side, i use the last index first.
I looked up how to change an integer into a string. Next I delete the first digit in the array and put together the  value and the seed.

I used long string and short string to test, it work well, it does have error.
