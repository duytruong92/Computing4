Name Duy Truong

I used the drawable libary to draw the recursive image. I have two code. 
One is original code and another one is sierpinski. In the Original. 
each big square i will draw 4 small square around and in the sierpinski. 
each big triangle i draw 3 small triangle.

we use vitural draw function to replace for the normal draw window function. 
it make use draw any shape or more than one 1 shape 1 time.

In my opinion we can save more memory because we dont need define more object we onlt need one.

I took me 2 days to finish.
